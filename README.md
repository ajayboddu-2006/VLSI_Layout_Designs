# VLSI Layout Designs
This repository showcases a collection of **layout designs** for **digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits**. These layouts are created as part of an ongoing effort to explore, implement, and refine various **VLSI design concepts**, focusing on **area, power, and performance optimization**.  

The repository provides reusable and well-documented layouts for a variety of circuit designs, ranging from basic digital logic gates to advanced mixed-signal components. Each layout is designed to comply with **industry-standard practices**, ensuring reliability and scalability for real-world applications.  

The goal of this repository is to:
- Enable knowledge sharing in the field of VLSI design.
- Provide a centralized hub for **innovative and reusable layouts**.
- Serve as a resource for students, researchers, and professionals to learn and contribute to IC design.  

As part of this project, the repository includes:
1. **Digital Layouts**
2. **Analog Layouts**
3. **Mixed-Signal Layouts**

All layouts are created using Magic VLSI and designed with the Sky130 Process Design Kit (PDK). Circuit verification is performed using NGSPICE, ensuring both accuracy and compliance with industry-standard design rules. The use of the Sky130 PDK enables compatibility with real-world fabrication processes, making the layouts more practical and scalable.

Contributions to this repository are highly encouraged to further expand and improve the collection of designs.
