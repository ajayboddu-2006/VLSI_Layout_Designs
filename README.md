# VLSI Layout Designs Repository

This repository showcases a collection of **layout designs** for digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits. These layouts are created as part of an ongoing effort to explore and implement various VLSI design concepts, focusing on optimizing area, power, and performance. The repository provides reusable and well-documented layouts for a variety of circuit designs.
